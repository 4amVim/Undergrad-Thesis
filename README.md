# Hi, didn't expect to see you here !
But hey, now that you are here, please do check out my [thesis](https://4amvim.github.io/Undergrad-Thesis/UG%20Thesis.pdf). It's written in a way so as to be readable by any STEM undergraduate. Or, perhaps have a look at [the presentation](https://4amvim.github.io/Undergrad/Presentation.pdf)(although it's not fun without an accompanying video).

For my thesis, I chose to rewrite [On the completion monad via the Yoneda embedding in quasi-uniform spaces](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166864111002525), by Maria Manuel Clementinoa and Dirk Hofmannb. The raison d'etre was to make it accessible to anyone with an understanding of undergraduate mathematics. My attempt did end up skipping the last section.

This repo also contains stuff from final semester of undergrad at SNU, pertaining to a course in analysis.

TL;DR This repo is here as a testament to the beating that quality takes when doing stuff at the eleventh hour. But stay posted for a rectification!

P.S. I'm (thinking of) working towards a way to visualize the concepts mentioned in it to make it even easier for beginners to broach the subject, but no ETAs yet.
